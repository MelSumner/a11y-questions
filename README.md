## A11y Questions

This repo is a collection of answers to questions I frequently get about digital accessibility (a11y).

If you have a question, all you have to do is file an issue! I'll do my best to quickly answer it in the form of a PR that adds to the knowledge base!

If you are an accessibility SME as well, and would like to contribute, feel free to open an issue with the question and a PR that resolves it!
